# Sleeptime App

A simple web application similar to sleepyti.me but limited to suggesting "wake up" times based on calculating sleep cycles.

- A sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes, and a good night's sleep consists of 5-6 sleep cycles.
- If you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle, you will feel groggy even if you've completed several cycles before waking up.
  The SleepTime App is made using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
